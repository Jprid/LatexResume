    \item Implemented Tenant-wide resource locking for Load jobs.

    \item Implemented Locale retrieval and configuration on Azure VM on tenant assignment.

    \item Integrated Azure Event Hub into multi-tenant worker code to produce events on job completion.

    \item Decoupling custom metadata binding APIs from worker logic and making them tenant-agnostic.

    \item Moved infrastructure components into shared libraries and refactoring to use Azure Key Vault for secret management.

\begin{tightemize}

    \item Implemented the ability to remove documents from review, and re-calculate de-duplication for affected data sources.

    \item Designed, delivered, and Implemented a feature that enables clients to re-run the ETL pipeline. This allows them to process documents with updated settings, allowing for the extraction of new metadata, and easing a common client pain point.

    \item Updated the functional test framework to be environment-aware: testing environments now clean up debug-resources that could cause noisy neighbor issues and/or potentially prevent full/accurate coverage of the codebase.

    \item Eliminated duplicate code paths, in the functional tests covering the Load step, by a factor of 4.

    \item Reduced flaky tests caused by noisy neighbor issues by implementing phases for functional test jobs.

    \item Increased transparency into the processing engine by allowing users to see all of the files run through the engine. Furthermore, in order to allow clients to more easily visualize the data coming back, grouping, and pivoting on properties was introduced.

    \item Enabled greater ease of disaster recovery by moving various automation assets into source code management. Furthermore, I consolidated the seeding and DSL logic into generic, config driven pipelines. Previously, developers would modify the configuration of 4 jobs on the Jenkins server's UI whereas following my changes.
